# AI-Based Intelligent Camera Decision-Making System

## Problem Statement

This project aims to design and implement an AI-based intelligent camera decision-making system to address challenges in traditional surveillance methods. The goal is to process video data, identify crucial events, and make real-time informed decisions. The system addresses issues such as human fatigue, delayed responses, and the need for continuous monitoring.

## Solution

### Integrating Pre-installed Security Cameras
- A cost-effective approach leveraging existing infrastructure.
- Upgrade camera firmware for compatibility.
- Implement adaptive machine learning for continuous improvement.

### Processing Real-time Video Data via Media Pipes
- Utilizing the Mediapipe framework for face and body pose recognition, hand tracking, etc.
- Implementing deep learning models (CNN) for object (arms) detection.
- Object detection using OpenCV.

### Triggers for Suspicious Activity on Authorized Person’s Handheld Device
- Mobile app integration for instant updates on suspicious activity.
- Location, photo, and timestamp of the incident provided with the alert.
- Email alerts for maintaining a record of the activity.

### Re-assurance in Case of Misjudged Decision
- Photo proof sent along with the alert to avoid misjudgments.

## Solution Implementation

#### Hardware and Infrastructure Setup
